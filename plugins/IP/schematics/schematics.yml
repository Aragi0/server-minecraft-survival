# -------- Add your schematics here --------
# Add your schematic random code or custom name here, followed by the difficulty.
# If your file is named parkour-d0f227d2, then you can either rename the file to parkour-4 ('4: 0.5') or
# just add 'd0f227d2: 0.5'. Any questions? Join the Discord.

# -------- The difficulty of schematics --------
# These are represented by a number below or equal to 1.0.

# Difficulties are also represented by an easy word, which is nice for users.
# Players who pick i.e. "hard" will get every schematic below difficulty 0.75, so sometimes they will get easy (0.25).
# 0.75 to 1.0 = very hard
# 0.5 to 0.75 = hard
# 0.25 to 0.5 = medium
# 0.0 to 0.25 = easy
