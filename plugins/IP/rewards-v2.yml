# ----------- Rewards v2 -----------
# Each command needs a separate line, as you can see below.
# You can copy the format below and change the score/commands to add a reward.
# Reward commands are executed by the console. Don't add "/"!
# Scores of 0 do not work.
# If no mode is specified, "default" will be used.

# Custom reward syntaxes:
# %player% - the player's name.
# test %player% - execute a console command. Don't add "/"!
# leave:test - executes a command on leave.
# send:<bold>test - sends a message.
# vault:-87 - deposits a specific amount of money (Vault required)
# default:test - mode-specific rewards. Mode names are "default", or for IP+ modes the same as the name used in the IP+ config.

# Rewards which will be given at certain intervals.
# An interval of 10 means a player will get a reward at 10, 20, 30, etc.

# -= One time rewards =-
# Rewards which players will receive just once.

# Changing the commands when a player already has achieved this score will not give it to them again.
# Warning: one-time rewards only work based on score. This might cause issues with per-mode rewards not being awarded.
